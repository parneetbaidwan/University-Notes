## Intro and Theory

### Chapter 1: Defining Applied Social Psychology
- A science that seeks to understand how people think about, relate to, and influence others
- Science involves:
  - A. **Research Methods** that in combination make up the scientific method
    - Empirical tests (systematic observatiosn) to evaluate ideas
  - B. A foundation of **core values**
    - Accuracy:
      - precise, error-free measurement and collection of information/data
    - Objectivity
      - minimization of bias in data collection and proposition testing
    - Skeptisism
      - refusing to believe findings and conclustions without rigorous verification
    - Open-Mindedness
      - readiness to accept as valid evidence that which may be inconsistent with ones initial theory
    - Ethics
      - acceptance of the absolute importance of ethical behavior in conducting research
- **Scientific Understanding**
  - Description
    - entails identifying and reporting the details and nature of a phenomenon
    - often distinguishing between classes or types of the phenomenon
    - recording its frequency of occurence
  - Prediction
    - about what factors are systematically related (correlated) to the phenomenon of interest
  - Determining causality
    - between two factors means determining the changes one factors produces in the other
  - Explanation
    - pertains to establishing why a phenomenon or relationship occurs

- **Ken & Kim vs. Scott and Jenn**
  - Anecdotes gives examples of the many ways in which people interact
    - Thinking
    - Feeling
    - Relating
    - Influencing
    - Conflict
  - All fits under the "umbrella" of social psychology

- **In-Groups vs. Out-Groups**
  - in-group members tend to evaluate and relate to the in-group more favourably than the out-group
    - evaluate to the out-group less favourably
  - extremely robust phenomenon 
    - it van show up even in a situation where there is just the slightest differentiation between in and out
  - Experiments:
    - Tajfel & Billig, 1974, divided participants - all strangers - into two groups 
      - this was done on the basis of trivial criteria
        - those who underestimate and those who overestimate the number of dots on slides
    - Participants consistently assigned more favourable rewards and traits to in-group members

### Chapter 1: Applied Social Psychology as a Science
- Refers to the branch os social psychology that draws on:
  - social psychological theories
  - principles
  - methods
  - research evidence
- This contributes to:
  - (a) the understanding of social and practical problems
  - (b) the development of intervention strategies for improving the functioning of:
    - individuals
    - groups
    - organizations
    - communities
    - socities
- the concern with the development of intervention strategies that is unique to applied social psych
- and sets it apart as a branch of social psychology

- Brief History:
  - 1800s - Ancient Greece
    - Philosphers
      - Socrates/Plato/Aristotle
      - Descartes (1596 - 1650) and Locke (1632 - 1704)
      - Kant (1724 - 1804)
      
  - Late 1800s
    - Fechner and psychophysics
    - Allows for measurement of psychological experiements of physical stimuli (perception)

  - Late 1800s/Early 1900s

      - Structuralism
    - James (United States)
      - Functionalism
