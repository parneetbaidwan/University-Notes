## Computer Programs

### Computer Programs
- A computer program consists of two parts:
  - Instructions or algorithms
  - Data

### Designing Computer Programs
- To simplify the design of a computer program it is divided into pieces or modules (steps)
      - eg) steps in getting ready: breakfast, shower, get ready
  - Module 1: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 2: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 3: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 4: Algorithms; Data
- Each module implements a specific functionality and modules interact with each other
      - eg) while in shower, thinking about breakfast

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- these modules are called objects
- OOP design principles include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
- the goal if the design principles is to simplify the tast of designing correct programs
- objects belong to classes
- two objects of the same class have the same algorithms and same type of data
      - class is a person, object is the action

### Encapsulation
- an object includes its own algorithms and data that it needs to perform a specific task
- these cannot be modified by objects of other classes

### Abstraction
- details of objects are private and not visible to objects of other classes
- each object provides specific rules for sharing its algorithms and data
  - Object 1
    - private: algorithms; data --> disallowed interaction
    - public: algorithms; data --> allowed interaction
  - Object 2
    - private: algorithms; data --> disallowed interaction
    - public: algorithms; data --> allowed interaction
