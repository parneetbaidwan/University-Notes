## Computer Programs

### Computer Programs
- A computer program consists of two parts:
  - Instructions or algorithms
  - Data

### Designing Computer Programs
- To simplify the design of a computer program it is divided into pieces or modules (steps)
      - eg) steps in getting ready: breakfast, shower, get ready
  - Module 1: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 2: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 3: Algorithms; Data
  - Module 4: Algorithms; Data
- Each module implements a specific functionality and modules interact with each other
      - eg) while in shower, thinking about breakfast

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- these modules are called objects
- OOP design principles include encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism
- the goal if the design principles is to simplify the tast of designing correct programs
- objects belong to classes
- two objects of the same class have the same algorithms and same type of data
      - class is a person, object is the action

### Encapsulation
- an object includes its own algorithms and data that it needs to perform a specific task
- these cannot be modified by objects of other classes

### Abstraction
- details of objects are private and not visible to objects of other classes
- each object provides specific rules for sharing its algorithms and data
  - Object 1
    - private: algorithms; data --> disallowed interaction
    - public: algorithms; data --> allowed interaction
  - Object 2
    - private: algorithms; data --> disallowed interaction
    - public: algorithms; data --> allowed interaction

### Arrays and Linked Structures
- the memory of a computer consists of a set of memory cells, each having a unique address
- an array: consists of a set of adjacent memory cells
- linked structure: consists of a set of cells that might appear anywhere in memory

### Stack
- Its like a tube
- Only open at one end
- Last entered is first to leave

### Queue
- Like a straw
- Open at two ends
- First one in is first one out
- Last one in is last one out

### List
- Open at all ends
- Can access any elements at any moment
- Grocery Shopping

### Tree
- Not a linear data structure

## Object Oriented Programming

### Objects
- In java and other OOP languages, the focus is on objects
- Objects are program modules that can do actions or be acted upon by other objects
- All objects have:
  - Properties
    - These are the data about an object
    - In Java these are called attributes or fields or instance variables
  - Behaviors (actions):
    - In Java they are implemented as methods (specifically instance methods)
- Every object belongs to a specific **class**
  - Objects of the same class have the same properties and can perform the same actions
- Classes can be thought of as a **template, pattern, model, or definition** for objects
