# CS1026 - Lecture 1

## Intro to Programming

### Calculating
Operators:
- +, -, *, /, exponents and parentheses
- Variables are used to save values
- Mathematical operators can be used for variables and numbers (literals)

### Variables
Variables hold values and update over time
Rules for naming:
- Letters, numbers and underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Use informative names

### Division
- Two types of Division: Division and Integer Division
- Division: Divide normally
    - eg) 12/5 = 2.4
- Integer Division: Decimal part is removed
    - eg) 12//5 = 2
- Related operation: mod (%): Gives you only the remainder numerical
    - eg) 12%5 = 2 --> (5+5+2 = 12)

### Statements and Expressions
- Expression: any combination of literals, variables, and operations
- Statement: a line of code that can be executed
- Assignment Statement: "Variable = Expression"
    - "assign the variable the value of the expression"
    - **Only a variable** on the left hand side
    - Equal sign is the assignment operator

### Saving Code
- Save as a .py file
- Executes all at once

### Algorithms
- Once we start saving code, we are implementing algorithms
- Algorithm: A sequence of steps that accomplish a specific task
    - Finite set of steps, depends on data that we get
    - Always solves the problem
- They aren't specific to a language like Python
- When solving problems, algorthms are written before the code is written

### Operations
- Function calls: trig functions, square root, floor, ceiling, logs
- Math module:
    - Import math
    - To use a function, give name and the information needed
    - Store the result in a variable or use an expression
- Math Operators:
    - math.sin, math.tan, math.cos, math.asin...(radians)
    - math.degrees, math.radians (to convert)
    - math.sqrt
    - math.exp, math.log, math.log10
    - math.pi
- Non-math Operators
    - abs() - calculate the absolute value of a numerical value
    - round() - round a numerical value (to a certain number of decimal points)
- String Operations
    - '+' - concatenation (adding strings together)
    - '*' repition
    - len(x) - gives length of string

### Strings
- Store zero or more characters
- Can be assigned to variables and used in expressions
- Define using single or double quotes(' ', " ")
    - eg) myStr = 'COMPSCI 1026B'

### Types
- Strings and numeric values (ints, floats) are different types
- One variable can hold different types over its lifetime
- Some operations only work for some types

### Extracting information from strings
- Can extract a character from a string
- Use square brackets after the string name and provide position
- Position begins at zero, not one

### String Tools
- myStr.upper() - uppercase version of myStr
- myStr.lower() - lowercase version of myStr
- myStr.replace(oldText, newText) -  create a new version with the replacements

### Special Characters
- \n - newline character
- \t - tab character
- \'' or \' - quote characters
- \\ - backslash character

### User Input
- input()
    - Function returns the input the user types
    - Can specify a prompt (string) as a parameter to the function
    - Typically, store user input in a variable
        - use float() to convert to float
        - use int() to convert to integer
        
### Formatting
- Basic method:
    - `print('I want to show you', var1, 'and', var2)`
- Formatted:
    - `print('I want to show you {} and {}'.format(var1, var2))`
    - {} is where the variable will go
- Can also format decimals
    - {:.2f} will result in 2 decimal places
    - `print('A number: {:.2f}'.format(floatingVar))

### Comments
- Anything written after '#' is a comment
- Ignored within the actual code
- Can also use ''' ''' for long paragraphs of comments


### circleArea.py
this program computes the area of a circle from its radius
```
userInp = input('Please type in the circle radius: ')
radius = float(userInp)
area = 3.141 * (radius**2) # area formula
print('The area of a circle with the radius {} is {:.2f).'.format(radius,area))
```
- output assuming radius is 2: 12.56

### firstCode.py
```
radius = 5
area = 3.141 * (radius**2)
print(area)
print(radius)

radius = 10
area = 3.141 * (radius**2)
print(area)
```
- output: 
    - 78.525
    - 5
    - 314.1
    
### firstInput.py
```
userInp = input('Type in your first name: ')
greeting = 'Hi' + userInp
print(greeting)
```
- output: Hi Parneet

### mathOps.py
```
import math
a = 1
b = 6
c = 3

x = (-b + math.sqrt(b**2 - 4*a*c)) / 2*a
print(x)
```
- output: -0.5505102572168221

### string.py
``` 
myString = 'this is some text'
secondString = 'more text'
print(myString + secondString)

newString = myString * 3
print(newString)

print(len(myString))
firstCharacter = myString[0]
print(firstCharacter)
```
- output:
    - this is some textmore text
    - this is some textthis is some textthis is some text
    - 17
    - t

## Conditions

### Conditions
- Conditions are a way to represent whether something is true or false
  - 3 > 5 
  - x >= 5

### Relational Operators
- Operators are needed to express conditions
- Comparisons between two values:
  - >, >=, <, <=
- Equality and non equality:
  - ==, !=

### If Statements
```
if(condition):
  #statement1
  #statement2
```
- Statements will only execute if the condition is true
- White space is very important --> Lines must be indented

### If with Else
```
if(condition):
  # executed if condition is TRUE
else:
  # executed if condition is FAlSE
```

### If, Elif, Else
```
if(condition1):
  # executes if condition1 is true
elif(condition2):
  # executes if condition2 is true
else:
  # executes if neither condition is true
```

### Boolean Operators
- and: true if both conditions are true
  - eg) x >= 0 and x <= 10
- or: true if one or both conditions are true
  - eg) grade < 0 or grade > 100
- not: "flip" the true - true if condition is false and vice versa
  - eg) not(x > 0)
  
- Short Circuit Evaluations
  - Evaluate the left operand and only evaluate the right if needed
    - or: if the left is true, expression is true
    - and: if left is false, expression is false
    
### Comparisons
- Comparing Floating Point Numbers
  - avoid using equality with floating point numbers:
    - 67.76 * 100
  - use epsilon - a small floating point tolerance that represents "close enough"
    - test |x - y| < epsilon for some small value of epsilon
      ```
      epsilon = 1e - 14
      if(abs(x-y) < epsilon):
      ```
- Comparing Strings
  - compare with == and !=
    - every single character in both strings are the same:
      - same length
      - each position is the same character
      
  - compare with < 
    - operator is true for two strings if they are in lexicographic order
      - "alphabetical order", "phone book order"
    - easy if two strings differ in some position
    - if one string is a prefix of the other, it comes first:
      - eg) David < Davidson
    - Numbers --> Uppercase --> Lowercase

### Boolean Values
- True and False
  - Store values in a variable:
    - `boolVar = True`
  - Can be the result of a comparison:
    - `boolVar = (1 > 3)`
  - Can use in if statements
    - ```
      boolVar = (1 > 3)
      if boolVar:
        print('...')
       ```
### Try-Except
- A condition Statement but without explicit conditions
- Used primarily for error handling
- ```
  userInput = input('Enter an integer: ')
  try:
    integerValue = int(userInput)
  except ValueError:
    print('Error, etc...')
  ```

### boolOps.py
```
grade = 50
if grade < 0 or grade > 100:
  print('grade is invalid')
else:
  print('grade is valid')
```

### elifExample.py
```
x = 10
y = 5
z = 30

if x == y:
  print('x and y are the same')
elif x > z:
  print('x is greater than z')
elif y > z:
  print('y is greater than z')
else:
  print('nothing above was true')

print('goodbye :)')
```

### firstIf.py
```
# short program showing how to use an if statement

# get user input
userInp = input('Enter your revenue: ')
revenue = float(userInp)

userInp = input('Enter your expenses: ')
expenses = float(userInp)

# your net
net = revenue - expenses

if net >= 0:
  print('You made a profit of ${}'.format(net))
  print('Good job!')
else:
  print('You lost ${}'.format(net))
  print('Better luck next time.')
print('Goodbye.')
```

## Iteration

### While Loops
- While Loop: Test a condition and execute the code if the condition is true, repeat
```
while(condition):
    #body
```

### Example Loop
```
counter = 0  # before loop
while(counter < 5):
    print('count is {}'.format(counter))
    counter = counter + 1
print('done loop')  # after loop
```

### While Loop Test
- While loop condition is tested:
    - when the loop is first encountered
    - after each execution of the body of the loop
- When designing your loop, make sure it captures what you want each time

### Infinite Loops
```
counter = 0
while (counter < 10):
    print('counter is {}'.format(counter))
```

- Missing an incrementation

### Other While Loop Pitfalls
- Floating point loops:
    - avoid use of floats, instead use integers
- Continue to update everytime

### Input Processing Loops
1. Verifying that a user inputs a correct value
2. Allowing multiple input

### Verifying Input
- Prompt the user for input
- While test should be - "while input is **no good**
- Inside loop: kindly remind user with prompt

### Allowing Multiple Loop
```
num = int(input('Enter a number(-1 to quit): ')
while(num != -1):
    # process num
    # prompt again
```
- Sentinel Value:
    - Special value that signals the end of input
    - Sentinel should not be a valid input value
 
### Flag Variables
- Can use a variable that stores a Boolean value as a **flag variable**
- The variable flags that the loop should end
- Useful for complex loops
```
boolVar = True
boolVar = (x > 0)
```

```
done = False  # done is the flag var
while (not done):
    # processing
    if (condition):
        done = True
    else:
        # more processing
```

### For Loop
- For loops are another form of a loop that work a predefined number of times
```
for i in range(5):
    print('the value of i is {}'.format(i))
```

### for loop or while loop
- for loop: 
    - if you know how many times the loop will execute
- while loop: 
    - if the condition relies on unknown information
    - if you can express a Boolean condition
 
### range()
- range(a,b,c)
    - a: starting value
    - b: end before this value (at b-1)
    - c: skip by this value
- examples:
    - range(4,20) --> 4, 5, 6, 7,...17, 18, 19
    - range(-5,10,3) --> -5, -2, 1, 4, 7

### For Loop over Strings
- Can use a for loop with range() for strings, but can also work with characters
```
for char in myStr:
    print(char)
```

### Nested Loops
- When loops are within loops: **Inner loop executes first**

```
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(4):
        print("{},{}".format(i,j))
```

output: 
- 0,0
- 0,1
- ...
- 1,0

### circleArea2.py
```
# this program computes the area of the circle from its radius

userInp = input('Please type in the circle radius (positive): ')
radius = float(userInp)

while radius < 0:
    # know that the input is bad
    userInp = input('Your input of {} was negative. Please enter a positive: '.format(radius))
    radius = float(userInp)

area = 3.141 * (radius**2)
print('The area of a circle with the radius {} is {:.2f}.'.format(radius,area))
```

output:
- input: -3
    - "Your input of -3 was negative. Please enter a positive: "
- input: 1
    - 3.141
    
### firstWhile.py
```
counter = 1

print('Before while loop')

while (counter <= 5):
    print('Counter is {}'.format(counter))
    counter += 1
    
print('After while loop')
```
output:
- Before while loop
- Counter is 1
- Counter is 2
- Counter is 3
- Counter is 4
- Counter is 5
- After while loop

### forLoops.py
```
# simple range statement
for i in range(10):
    print('The value of i is {}.'.format(i))
    if i <= 3:
        print('small')
    else:
        print('large')
        
# even numbers here
for i in range(2,10,2):
    print('The value of i is {}.'.format(i))
    if i <= 3:
        print('small')
    else:
        print('large')

myStr = 'abcdef'

for char in myStr:
    print(char)    
```

output:
    - The value of i is 0.
    - small
    - The value of i is 1.
    - small
    - ...
    - The value of i is 9.
    - large

    - The value of i is 2.
    - small
    - The value of i is 8.
    - large

    - a
    - b
    - f
    
### nested.py
```
for i in range(5):
    print('starting i loop')
    for j in range(4):
        print('{},{}'.format(i,j))

print('done')
```

- output:
    - starting i loop
    - 0,0
    - ...
    - 0,3
    - starting i loop
    - 1,0
    - ...
    - 1,3
    - starting i loop
    - 2,0
    - ...
    - 2,3
    - starting i loop
    - 3,0
    - ...

## Randomness and Simulation

### Random Numbers
- Useful for:
    - Games: introduce an element of randomness for user
    - Simulations: many complex problems can be solves approximately using randomness

### Generating Random Numbers
- Use random library
- random() function:
    - generates a number between 0 and 1: (0 <= r <= 1)
    - need to import
```
from random import random  # 1st - module; 2nd - function
r = random()
```

### "Random"
- The numbers aren't actually random: **pseudorandom**
- They are generated deterministically: repeat pattern length 2^19937 - 1
- Python documentation: "not suitable for cyrptographic purposes

### Pseudorandom and Seed
- Pseudorandom starts with a seed
- If the random generator gets the same seed, it generates the same results
- By default, the seed is based on the current time
- Setting the same seed value can be helpful to help debug your code
`random.seed(10)`
