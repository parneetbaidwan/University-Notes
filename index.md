# CS1026 - Lecture 1

## Intro to Programming

### Calculating
Operators:
- +, -, *, /, exponents and parentheses
- Variables are used to save values
- Mathematical operators can be used for variables and numbers (literals)

### Variables
Variables hold values and update over time
Rules for naming:
- Letters, numbers and underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Use informative names

### Division
- Two types of Division: Division and Integer Division
- Division: Divide normally
    - eg) 12/5 = 2.4
- Integer Division: Decimal part is removed
    - eg) 12//5 = 2
- Related operation: mod (%): Gives you only the remainder numerical
    - eg) 12%5 = 2 --> (5+5+2 = 12)

### Statements and Expressions
- Expression: any combination of literals, variables, and operations
- Statement: a line of code that can be executed
- Assignment Statement: "Variable = Expression"
    - "assign the variable the value of the expression"
    - **Only a variable** on the left hand side
    - Equal sign is the assignment operator

### Saving Code
- Save as a .py file
- Executes all at once

### Algorithms
- Once we start saving code, we are implementing algorithms
- Algorithm: A sequence of steps that accomplish a specific task
    - Finite set of steps, depends on data that we get
    - Always solves the problem
