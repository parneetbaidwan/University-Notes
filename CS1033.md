## What is Multimedia; Multimedia History; Design Tips; Font/Text Tips

### What is Multimedia
- Term coined around 1962
- Wiki: "Multimedia is media and content that uses a combination of different content forms"
- Merriam: "A technique for expression ideas in which several medias are employed
- Cambridge: "Using a combination of moving and still pictures, sounds, music, and words"

### Multimedia Uses
- To inform
- To educate
- To sell and run businesses
- To entertain

- 2001: Apple introduces iTunes and the iPod
- 2005: youtube.com launches
- 2006: First twitter message sent
- 2007: Google surpasses Microsoft as the most valuable global brand and is most visited

### Design Principles
- CRAP Principles
  - Contrast: Avoid making 2 elements similar; make them the same or very different
  - Repition: Repeat some aspect of the design throughout (Bold font, colour, bullet etc.)
  - Alignment: Items are aligned - creating a stronger cohesive unit
  - Proximity: Group related things together

### Monitors and Pixels
- Monitor: A rectangular area broken down into very small coloured pieces or dots 
- Pixels: Used to represent anything that is displayed visually on a screen


- Q: On a 17in monitor, we could have 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768. Which will have larger pixels
- A: 800 x 600

### Monitors and Printer
- A pixel is displayed using light on a monitor to create images or text
- When **printing** text or images, we use ink to create the pixel but in printing, the pixels are called **dots**
- Dots are like pixels:
  - Take on different colours
  - Can be big, creating bigger images, or small, creating smaller images

- Q: Which will have bigger dots: 72dpi or 300dpi
- A: 72dpi will be bigger --> less dots in same space means larger size

### The Use of Text on a Website
- Text has two purposes:
  - Convey information
  - Graphical element of the page
- Text can set a mood, hence, make your choice based on:
  - Your audience:
    - Children
    - Teens
    - Young adults
    - Elders
   - Application:
    - Educational
    - Entertainment
    - Business
- Font Type (Typeface)
  - Characters that have a common design are grouped into families
  - Typically divided into two categories: Serif or Sans Serif
    - Serif: has a fine line added to finish a letter stroke
      - Always use for large paragraphs
      - eg) Times New Roman
    - Sans Serif: no line added
      - Best for headlines and headings
      - eg) Comic, Arial

### Kerning
- Kerning: the distance between individual letters
  - eg) AS vs HN

### Tracking
- Tracking: the distance between ALL the letters; measured in ems

### Leading
- Amount of vertical space between lines of text
- As the length of a line increases, it is harder for the reader to jump to the next line

### Tracking and Leading Examples
```
**Loose Track More Leading**

O k a y,  t h a t  m i g h t  

b e  s u b j e c t i v e.
```

```
**Loose Track Less Leading**

O k a y,  t h a t  m i g h t  
b e  s u b j e c t i v e.
```

```
**Tight Track More Leading**

Okay, that might

be subjective.
```

```
**Tight Track Less Leading**

Okay, that might
be subjective.
```

### Monospaced Fonts vs. Proportional Fonts
- Monospaced Fonts: Fonts in which each letter space is the same size
  - the width of each letter is the same
    - the width of W and I is the same
- Proportional Fonts: Fonts in which letters have respective sizes based on their shape
  - the width of each letter will be different
    - the width of W will be larger than I

### Font Size
- Font size can be measured in several different units:
  - points, picas: absolute length - MSWord (72 is 1 inch)
  - pixels: relative to the screens resolution
  - percentage, ems: relative to the default browser font
  - inches, cm: absolute length
  
- Which to use:
  - Accessibility: use ems or % as they are relative to default font 
  - Control: use pixels for more precision

### Font Colour
- **Hexadecimal Representation**
  - Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
    - With two space holders: 99 is big, 19 is small
    - With two space holders: FF is big, IF is small
  - Must start with #, then two digts for red, two for green, and two for blue
  - Examples:
    - #000000: Black
    - #0000FF: Blue
    - #00FF00: Green
    - #FF0000: Red
    - #FFFFFF: White
    - #660099: Western Purple
    - #FFFF00: Yellow
    - #222222: Dark Grey
    - #CCCCCC: Light Grey

## Introduction to Graphics

### How We Represent/Encode the World
- **Before Computers:**
  - 1880: Drawings, language, paintings, books, word of mouth
  - 1990: Photographs, movies, TV, record albums
    - Thoughts represented using language, words, pictures
    - Language represented using lettes, from which words are made
    - Before 1980s, thoughts saved using books, diaries, and journals
    - Now, thoughts saved using blogs and social media

- **Representing Numbers in History:**
  - Humans represent costs and quatities using decimals numbers
  - Before computers, humans calculated costs using calculators
    - Before calculators: 
      - 1950: Slide Rulers
      - 1600: Abacus

### Number Systems
- Binary System: 0s and 1s
- Quaternary Numeral System: 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s
- Octal Numeral System: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Decimal System: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
- Hexadecimal System: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F

### Bits and Bytes
- Bit: Single bit of information
  - 1 bit: represents 2 things
  - 2 bits: represents 4 things
    - Follows 2^x
- Byte: 8 bits together
  - Represents 255 different things (numbers 0-256)
  - 2^x tells us the number of possibilities we have for x bits

### Converting Binary to Decimal
- Can use binary to represent different numbers and letters
- Computers like binary because they use electricity
  - Can distinguish b/w high volt and low volt:
    - high: 1
    - low: 0
- **ASCII**
  - Standard binary coding with 8 bits (1 byte) used to represent letters
  - With 8 bits (1 byte), 256 different characters can be encoded (2^8)
  - 2 bytes are used to represent characters from different languages
- **Unicode**
  - Code using 2 bytes
- **Conversion**
  - If the digit is 0: Ignore it
  - If the digit is 1:
    - get the place value and calculate 2 to the power of that digit

  - Begin at right
  - Add the sums
  - Hint:
    - if right digit is 1: odd number
    - if right digit is 0: even number

### Converting Analog to Binary
- Everything we want to show/hear on a computer MUST be encoded
- World is represented in analog format, but a computer can't make something analog
- Analog: Smooth, Continuous

### Converting Analog to Digital:
- Sampling: how often is a sample taken to represent parts of a thing
- Quantizing: how many discrete values will be used to represent parts of the thing
  - The more chunks you can break something into, the better the quality
  - More samples: closer to an analog representation
  - 24 bits: 16 million colours to represent the colour of each square

### Images and Pixels
- DPI: dots per inch
- PPI: pixels per inch

- When scanning or getting an image, the scanner/camera determines how many samples to take
- More samples: higher resolution
- Samples on scanners/printers: DPI
- Samples on monitor: PPI

- Images represented by a grid (array, matrix) of a squared **p**icture **el**ement: **pixel**
- A pixel:
  - smallest image component and this shows the smallest detail
  - arranged in columns and rows
  - each pixel is given a numerical value that represents a corresponding colour
  - **When printing, always print with dpi of atleast 300**

### Getting Images on a Computer:
1. Scanning existing images (analog images)
2. Taking a picture with our digital camera (automatically digitizes analog picture)
3. By creating something original using MSPaint or Photoshop or some graphics program

### Megapixel
- How many millions of pixels you can capture in a photograph on your digital camera
- A camera with more megapixels prints larger images without the eye detecting loss of quality

### Images on Paper vs. Monitor
- The monitor is made up of rows of screen pixels; each pixel gets a colour
- Map the pixels on screen pixels in one-to-one mapping and see our image

- Screen Resolution: Number of pixels across by number of pixels down

### Displaying Images on a Screen
- Amount of space the images takes up on the screen is dependent on size and resolution
- NOT THE DPI

### PPI of Monitors
- Average PPI for monitors: 72 PPI
- Image smaller -> removes pixels, makes it crisper, gives smaller file size
- Image bigger -> computer guesses colours, more pixels; pixelated, bigger file size

- More pixels: greater file size
- Less pixels: smaller file size

### File size and Pixels
- The file size is determined by the number of pixels
- DPI/PPI does not make a difference in size


# CS1033 - Lecture 3

## Graphics

### Quantizing the Image
- Assume for each pixel, there is 1 bit to represent the colour
  - 0 could be white
  - 1 could be black
    - Therefore, 1 bit allows for 2 colours, usually black or white (2^1 = 2)
      - 00 -> white
      - 01 -> light grey
      - 10 -> dark grey
      - 11 -> black


### Subtractive Model - CMYK
- Used for printing
- Ink applied to paper
- Primary Colours: Cyan, Magenta, Yellow
- Ink when applied removes (subtracts) the white

### Additive Model - RGB
- Used on Monitors
- "Adding" light to a black background (the monitor)
- Primary Colours: Red, Green, Blue

### How to represent the colours on a Monitor
- True Colour:
  - Can represent 2^24 colours
    - About 16 million different colours

  - 2^24 = 2^8 * 2^8 * 2^8:
    - 256 shades of red * 256 shades of green * 256 shades of blue

  - Need 3 bytes (1 byte = 8 bits) for True Colour (1 byte per colour)

### Encoding True Colour
- **RGB** <Amount of Red, Amount of Green, Amount of Blue> - Decimal Number
  - Where 0 means no amount and 255 is the most allowed
  - <255, 0, 0> -> the most red, no green, no blue: red
  - <0, 255, 0> -> the most green, no red, no blue: green
  - <0, 0, 255> -> the most blue, no red, no green: blue
  - <100, 100, 100> -> equal amounts: grey
  - <50, 0, 200> -> little red, lots of blue: royal blue
  - <200, 0, 50> -> lots of red, little blue: dark red

- **Hexadecimal Code** #RRGGBB
  - RR: digit placeholder for amount of red
  - GG: digit placeholder for amount of green
  - BB: digit placeholder for amount of blue
  - Amounts are counted in hexadecimal: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
  - Hex FF = RBG 255
  - #FF0000 -> red
  - #00FF00 -> green
  - #0000FF -> blue

### Indexed Color (Not True Colour)
- At most, there is only 256 shades of colour (8 bits)
  

### Bitmapped Images 
- Bitmapped Graphic Image:
  - Image consists of pixels in a grid
  - Icons are an example of a bitmapped image (usually 32 x 32 pixels)
  - When bitmapped images are enlarged (resampled) interpolation occurs:
    - comp adds new pixels and guesses on the colour to colour new pixels based on surrounding
  - Bitmapped images edges become jagged

- Bitmapped Images
  - Also called Raster Graphics Image
  - Resolution Dependent:
    - Image on 640x840 (less res) screen appear larger than on a 1280x1024 (high res)
  - Images that are enlarged: 
    - Have larger file size than original
    - Become distorted
  - All images from scanners and digital cameras are bitmapped images
 
 ### Common Bitmap Formats
 - BMP (little compression, big files)
 - GIF
 - JPEG, JPG
 - PNG
 - PICT (Macintosh)
 - PCX
 - TIFF
 - AFPHOTO
 - PSD (photoshop)

### Common Bitmap Editing Tools
- Microsoft Paint
- Adobe Photoshop
- Affinity Photo
- Corel Photo-Pain
- Corel Paint Shop Pro
- The Gimp
  
### Vector Graphics
- Vector image is made up of individual, scalable objects
- Objects are defined by mathematical equations
- Objects consist of lines, curves, and shapes
- No distortion as image is enlarged (crisp lines always)
- Most browswers don't display vector graphics without a plug in
- Only can be used with drawings, not photographs
- Usually vector graphic image has a smaller file size than the same image stored as a bitmap
- Great for logos:
  - Can be scaled down for business card
  - Can be scaled up for a trade show poster

### Common Vector File Formats
- AI (Adobe Illustrator)
- CDR
- CMX
- CGM
- DXF AutoCAD
- WMF Windows Metafile
- EPS
- PDF

### Common Vector Drawing Programs
- Adobe Illustrator
- Affinity Designer
- CorelDRAW
- Xara Xtreme
- Serif DrawPlus

### How Big Is An Image
- bytes = total number of pixels (sampling) * colour big depth (quantize)
- bytes = length (px) * width (px) * colour bit depth (bytes)
- Units of Measure:
  - 1 KB = 1024 B
  - 1 MB = 1024 KB
  - 1 GB = 1024 MB
  - 1 TB = 1024 GB

### Printing vs. Displaying
- Printing in a Flyer or Magazine
  - File size doesn't matter
  - Quality of image is most important
  - Printed with atleat 300 dpi

- Displaying in a Web Page
  - File size is very important
  - Bigger files take longer to download
  - Quality is important too but want to try and get best quality with smallest size

### Downloading Fast
- Make image files smaller but keep image at same quality
  - Physically smaller = less pixels
  - eg) 100x100 (30KB) is smaller than 200x200 (118KB)
- Compress the Image
  - use tricks to make the file smaller without losing its quality
  - An uncompressed image that is:
    - 200 x 200 pixels
    - True Colour
    - Will be 200*200*3 bytes = 120,000 bytes
    - Will be 120,000 / 1024 = 117.2 KB

  - An image that is 200 x 200 pixels
  - Original size 118 KB (200*200*3)
  - Looks almost like true colour when:
    - Saved as Compressed JPG will be:
      - Highest Quality: 58 KB
      - Lowest Quality: 25 KB

    - Saved as a Compressed GIF will be:
      - 256 Colours -> 29 KB
      - 64 Colours -> 17 KB
      - 16 Colours -> 7 KB
      - 10 Colours -> 3 KB

### Compression
- Two Types:
  - Lossless:
    - Compress the original bits and bytes into less without losing any original info 
    - When reopen file, all original info is still there
    - NO INFORMATION LOST
  - Lossy:
    - When compression occurs, some original info is lost
    - Selected portions of image are discarded (ones that will be least missed)
    - CANNOT GET THIS BACK

- Algorithsm For Compression
  - Each different type of image file format represents a different compression algorithm
  - Common compressed image formats that are accepted on World Wide Web
    - gif
    - jpg, jpeg
    - png

  - Uncompressed file formats:
    - bmp
    - raw


# CS1033 - Lecture 4

## Graphics Continued

### Servers vs. Clients
- Web servers:
  - A computer that delivers (serves up) web pages
  - Advantages:
    - Connected: Computer is aon all the time and always connected to the internet
    - Always Available: Never turned off, hence website is always available
    - Well Maintained: People running will ensure proper security and maintencence
- Client:
  - The computer that is requesteing to see/visit the web page
  - Many clients will visit one server

### Compression Concepts
- Several different ways to do compression depending on the type of image
- Compression for images with large blocks of the same colour:
  - If an image is 100 px high by 200 px wide, 20,000 pixels are required to store info
  - RAW:
    - Raw has no compression - large file
    - stores the info of each pixel one at a time: top left to right, to bottom right
    - Each colour is 3 byte, so 60,000 bytes of information is stored
    - Instead (rectangular shapes):
      - Break down shape into smaller shapes
      - End with 35 bytes

- Compression with Patterns:
  - Look for patterns:
    - eg) 143451434514345
      - If 'i' represents 14345, compresses to 'iii'
  - Build a decoding hash table:
    - 0  13245
    - 1  14345
    - 2  23423
    - 3  11223
      - Pattern: 1324523423143451122323423
      - Compressed: 02132

  - Compressing Words:
    - ASCII Code: Each letter is represented by 8 bits
    - Huffman Coding: use the least number of bits for common letters and more for less common
      - eg) see 
        - ASCII: 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 bits
        - Huffman: 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 bits

      - eg) zoo
        - ASCII: 8 + 8 + 8
        - Huffman: 11 + 4 + 4 = 19 bits


### Picking Appropriate File Format
- Depends on type of image being represented
- 3 main file formats:
  - GIF
  - JPG
  - PNG

### GIF
- Graphic Interchange Format
- Widely used on the World Wide Web
- Only supports 8 bit colour
- Good for clipart, logos, animation
- Looks for large blocks of area that all have the same colour
- Saving an image with 24 bit colour as gif lowers quality the first time you convert it
- Produces smaller file sizes than jpgs
- Does a lossless compression:
  - 200x200 and original had 256 colours or less
  - no compression: 200 * 200 * 3/1024 = 117KB
  - gif compression: 
    - with 256 colours: 8.4KB
    - with 16 colours: 5KB
    - NO CHANGE IN QUALITY: LOSSLESS COMPRESSION

- GIF -> Transparency
  - One Colour Transparency:
  - Allows for transparency of ONE colour
  - BAckground will show through

- GIF -> Animation
  - Allows for animation
  - Don't need a plug in
  - Works in all browsers, universal format

- GIF -> Dithering
  - Juxtaposing pixels of two colours to create an illusion of a third colour
    - eg) Placing red and blue next to each other creating an illusion of purple

- GIF -> Interlacing
  - How images are downloaded to your screen
  - Interlacing lets you 'preview' the whole picture without making you wait for download
  - The image is drawn in a series of passes rather than all at the same time

- GIF -> Compression
  - Can compress more by reducing the number of colours in the image


### JPG(JPEG)
- Joing Photographic Experts Group
- Used Widely
- Supports 24 bit colour
- Great for photographs
- Larger files than GIFs but allows for a full colour scheme
- Best for blends of colour, softer shadow effects, subtle changes in colour
- NOT good for well defined lines or sharp contrasts between colours
- Lossy Compression:
  - Discards more data about colours than brightness
  - Degrades image quality
  - Degree of info lost can be varied by adjusting compression parameters

- JPG: 
  - No Transparency
  - No Animation
  - No Interlacing
  - No Dithering

### PNG
- Created specifically because of licencing issues with GIFs in 90s
- Lossless Compression
- 3 Versions of PNG:
  - PNG-8
    - Similar to GIF
    - Allows for 256 Colours, 1 transparent colour
    - Storing of colour is more efficient in PNG, files may be smaller
  - PNG-24 and PNG-32
    - Allows for 24 bit colour
    - Lossless compression
    - Allows for transparency on each pixel with different levels of opacity:
      - PNG-32 allows for a full palette with full transparency
      - PNG-24 allows for varying levels of transparency, you will lose some colour

  - No one else is permitted to make profit from their work

- No-Derivaties: Equal Sign
  - No permission to change the photo

- Share Alike: Reload Arrow

### Copyright
- your rights to control your works of creative expression
- you can copyright anything that is tangible:
  - drawing, song, photographs, music, scultptures

### Computer Network
- Network: a group of interconnected computers (wireless, wires, satellites)

### The Internet
- Internet: a glocal system of interconnected networks that use TCP/IP to serve
  - A network of networks
  - A hardware wheras the World Wide Web is a software

- Uses TCP/IP to work
  - A standard protocal
  - Has no direct line at the outset of the message:
    - if communication line is broken, another line is tried
    - Opposite to home telephone

- Circuit Switching: Stopping all traffic on the route of communication (phone line)
- Packet: small group of bytes consisting of header, destination and source, and the body
- Protocol: Rules for the format and transmission of data

### TCP
- At the sending end:
  - Take a large chunk of data and breaks it into smaller packets
  - Sends the packets out on to the Internet

- At the receiving end:
  - Detects lost packets, packets with erros, traffic load balancing, other unpredictables
  - Requests that packets be resent
  - Rearranges and reassembles packets back into webpage, email etc on the receivers machine

- Packet Switching: How to send the message (a webpage)
  - TCP breaks down webpage into packets of bytes
  - TCP figures out IP address of destination
  - TCP figures out IP address of source
  - Sends off each packet to first machine(IP address) on the route
  - Packet stops at first machine (likely a router), then router sends it to next machine
    - Repeats until final destination


### IP
- Like a GPS
- Picks a route for packet, stopping at routers which pick the next best network/machine
- If communication line id down or broken, sends packet back to TCP which tries a diff route
- Needs to be able to identify all machines on internet
- Uses IP Addresses
  - 4 numbers with dots between them
  - Between 0 and 255
    - eg) 129.100.23.247
  - Always 32 bits
  - Can be expressed as:
    - Dotted quad: 129.100.23.247
    - Binary: 10000001 01100100 00010111 11110111
    - Hexadecimal: 81 64 17 F7
    - Decimal: 2, 170, 820, 599

  - Newer ones are 128 bits

### Domain Names
- DNS (Domain Name System) maps the domain name to the correct IP address
- Most cases: one to one mapping between ip address and domain name
  - 129.100.23.247 maps to www.csd.uwo.ca
- Sometimes it may link to more than one:
  - 155.12.12.12 maps to www.chapters.ca and www.indigo.ca
- Some domain names might map to more than one IP Address

- Domain names identify machines on the internet, eg) a web server machine
- Web server: contains all the web pages for a company or individual
- Web Pages: stored on the web server machine in folders/directories
- Web site: really just a folder; extension .html

- https://www.csd.uwo.ca
  - www: reference to world wide web
  - csd: third level domain; sub domain of uwo.ca
  - uwo: second level domain
  - .ca: top level domain: only certain have been established as top level domains

- Rules for Domain Dames
  - Max 127 levels
  - 63 characters long/level
  - Whole cannot be greater than 255 characters
  - Use approved TLDs
  - Consist of letters, digits, and hyphens
  - No spaces
  - Case insensitive

### Top Level Domains
- Originals: .com  .org  .net  .int  .edu  .gov  .mil
- Country: .ca  .ae  .uk  .de
- Geographical: .asia  .berlin  .vegas
- Brands: .bloomberg  .barclays  .youtube


### URL
- Points at a web page on the internet
- https://www.uwo.ca/its/courses/spring.html
  - http: hypertest transfer protocol
  - www: world wide web
  - uwo.ca: domain name
  - its: folder
  - courses: folder
  - spring.html: file

### Picking a Domain NAme
1. Keywords
2. Be Memorable
3. Avoid Hyphens
4. .com first
5. Keep it Short
6. Kill Procrastination
7. Get Creative
8. Know the Rules
9. Testing

- Each webpage is normally an html file with extension .html or .htm
  - This is a very basic page with clickable links, images, and sometimes forms
  - first page called index.html
- Sometimes it can have an extension  .php
  - allows for extra stuff that is brought in 


### Web Server
- the computer that runs software which holds the webpages and delivers webpage to client
- the computer must be connected to the internet

### Web Browswer
- Test your website by opening it in a web browser
- software/program that displays formatted webpages to the client

### HTML
- 1980s - 1990s: 
  - Tim Berners Lee proposed and set specifications for HTML language
  - He proposed tags that start and end with <>

### Building a Web Page
- Content -> Create an HTML file
- Looks -> Create an CSS file
- Behavior -> Create a Javascript File

## Searching

### How Search Engines Work
- Two Parts:
  - Part 1: Building the Search Database
    - Finding all the data on web and building a database
    - Web Crawlers/Web Spiders crawl the internet constantly looking at all words 
      - They collec these words and build an index
    - Index contains list of alphabetical list of words it finds, location, and link
    - Words are called keywords
  - Part 2: Deciding what Pages to Return
    - Given keywords, returning "best/most appropriate" pages
    - Uses index to decide which pages have the given keywords
    - Every engine uses slightly different algorithms to decide the order of displaying 
    - Google uses "PageRank"

### Page Rank
- Algorithm gives each webpage weight of 0 or 1
- The higher the weight, the more likely it is to be displayed
- Eg) Assume only 4 pages, Page A, B, C, D
- Each page has weight 0.25
  - Scenario 1:
    - B, C, D all have a link to A
    - Then, B, C, D are giving their 0.25 to A, so A has ranking of 0.75
  - Scenario 2:
    - B links to A and C (0.25 divided between 2)
    - C links to A (0.25 goes to A)
    - D links to A, B, C (0.25 divided by 3)
      - Weight of A:
        - 0.24/2 (b) + 0.25 (c) + 0.25/3 (d)
        - 0.125 + 0.25 + 0.083 = 0.458
- PageRank evaluates 2 key factors:
  - how many links there are to a webpage
  - quality of linking sites
- does not take into account the content of the page
- ranks webpages not websites


### SEO
- Search Engine Optimization
- 3 components to make your site more visible:
  - text
    - identify keywords
    - put keywords in best locations
  - links
    - ensure that links are easy to navigate so web spiders can search easily
  - popularity
    - 2 parts:
      - link popularity: high quality links
      - click through popularity: how many times clicked on, return rate, length of stay

## Animation

### Animation
- A sequence of images that create the illusion of movement when played in succession:
  - Indicates movement
  - Illustrates change over time
  - Visualizes 3D objects
  - Attracts attention
- Each drawing is called a Frame
- On movies: 24 frames per second required (fps)
- On tv: 30 frames per second
- Computer Animation: 12-15 fps

### Sampling and Quantizing of Motion
- Each frame is just an image:
  - each frame is sampled into discrete samples and each sample beomes a pixel (sampling)
  - Each pixel gets assigned a colour (1 bit: b/w; 24 bit: 16 million) (Quantizaiton)

### 2D Animation
- Two types of 2D animation:
  - Cel Animation: traditional, hand-drawn, frame by frame
  - Path Based Animation
    - Pick a starting, ending, and follow point
    - Then the computer generating all the frames in between (**TWEENING**) 
    - No intermediate frams are drawn

### Types of Animation
- Traditional (Cel) Animation
  - Must hand draw every single frame
- 2D Animation
- Computer Animation
  - 3D animation involves 3 steps:
    - Modelling
    - Rendering
    - Animating
- Motion Graphics
- Stop Motion
