### What is Multimedia

### Design Principles
- CRAP Principles
  - Contrast: Avoid making 2 elements similar; make them the same or very different
  - Repition: Repeat some aspect of the design throughout (Bold font, colour, bullet etc.)
  - Alignment: Items are aligned - creating a stronger cohesive unit
  - Proximity: Group related things together

### Monitors and Pixels
- Monitor: A rectangular area broken down into very small coloured pieces or dots 
- Pixels: Used to represent anything that is displayed visually on a screen


- Q: On a 17in monitor, we could have 800 x 600 or 1024 x 768. Which will have larger pixels
- A: 800 x 600

### Monitors and Printer
- A pixel is displayed using light on a monitor to create images or text
- When **printing** text or images, we use ink to create the pixel but in printing, the pixels are called **dots**
- Dots are like pixels:
  - Take on different colours
  - Can be big, creating bigger images, or small, creating smaller images

- Q: Which will have bigger dots: 72dpi or 300dpi
- A: 72dpi will be bigger --> less dots in same space means larger size

### The Use of Text on a Website
- Text has two purposes:
  - Convey information
  - Graphical element of the page
- Text can set a mood, hence, make your choice based on:
  - Your audience:
    - Children
    - Teens
    - Young adults
    - Elders
   - Application:
    - Educational
    - Entertainment
    - Business
- Font Type (Typeface)
  - Characters that have a common design are grouped into families
  - Typically divided into two categories: Serif or Sans Serif
    - Serif: has a fine line added to finish a letter stroke
      - Always use for large paragraphs
      - eg) Times New Roman
    - Sans Serif: no line added
      - Best for headlines and headings
      - eg) Comic, Arial

### Kerning
- Kerning: the distance between individual letters
  - eg) AS vs HN

### Tracking
- Tracking: the distance between ALL the letters; measured in ems

### Leading
- Amount of vertical space between lines of text
- As the length of a line increases, it is harder for the reader to jump to the next line

### Tracking and Leading Examples
```
**Loose Track More Leading**

O k a y,  t h a t  m i g h t  

b e  s u b j e c t i v e.
```

```
**Loose Track Less Leading**

O k a y,  t h a t  m i g h t  
b e  s u b j e c t i v e.
```

```
**Tight Track More Leading**

Okay, that might

be subjective.

```
**Tight Track Less Leading**

Okay, that might
be subjective.

### Monospaced Fonts vs. Proportional Fonts
- Monospaced Fonts: Fonts in which each letter space is the same size
  - the width of each letter is the same
    - the width of W and I is the same
- Proportional Fonts: Fonts in which letters have respective sizes based on their shape
  - the width of each letter will be different
    - the width of W will be larger than I

### Font Size
- Font size can be measured in several different units:
  - points, picas: absolute length - MSWord (72 is 1 inch)
  - pixels: relative to the screens resolution
  - percentage, ems: relative to the default browser font
  - inches, cm: absolute length
  
- Which to use:
  - Accessibility: use ems or % as they are relative to default font 
  - Control: use pixels for more precision

### Font Colour
- **Hexadecimal Representation**
  - Digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
    - With two space holders: 99 is big, 19 is small
    - With two space holders: FF is big, IF is small
  - Must start with #, then two digts for red, two for green, and two for blue
  
  - Examples:
    - #000000: Black
    - #0000FF: Blue
    - #00FF00: Green
    - #FF0000: Red
    - #FFFFFF: White
    - #660099: Western Purple
    - #FFFF00: Yellow
    - #222222: Dark Grey
    - #CCCCCC: Light Grey
